# Multi Format Instructions

* We have 2 pydantic schema for suppose Booking and Cancel
* We can let the model choose which is the best schema for it
* So our model will be able to respond in different schema
* Union can be used only with ToolStrategy

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal, Union
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.structured_output import ToolStrategy


class ProductReview(BaseModel):
    """Analysis of a product review."""
    rating: int | None = Field(description="The rating of the product", ge=1, le=5)
    sentiment: Literal["positive", "negative"] = Field(description="The sentiment of the review")
    key_points: list[str] = Field(description="The key points of the review. Lowercase, 1-3 words each.")

class CustomerComplaint(BaseModel):
    """A customer complaint about a product or service."""
    issue_type: Literal["product", "service", "shipping", "billing"] = Field(description="The type of issue")
    severity: Literal["low", "medium", "high"] = Field(description="The severity of the complaint")
    description: str = Field(description="Brief description of the complaint")

agent = create_agent(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    tools=tools,
    response_format=ToolStrategy(Union[ProductReview, CustomerComplaint])
)

result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this review: 'Great product: 5 out of 5 stars. Fast shipping, but expensive'"}]
})
result["structured_response"]
# ProductReview(rating=5, sentiment='positive', key_points=['fast shipping', 'expensive'])

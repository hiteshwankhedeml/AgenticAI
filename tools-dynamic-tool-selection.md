# Tools - Dynamic Tool Selection

* The set of tools available to the agent is modified at runtime rather than defined all upfront
* Too many tools may overwhelm the model (overload context) and increase errors; too few limit capabilities
* Enables adapting the available toolset based on authentication state, user permissions, feature flags, or conversation stage
* Two approaches:
  * Filtering pre-registered tools:
    * When all possible tools are known at agent creation time, you can pre-register them and dynamically filter which ones are exposed to the model based on state, permissions, or context

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import wrap_model_call, ModelRequest, ModelResponse
from typing import Callable

@wrap_model_call
def state_based_tools(
    request: ModelRequest,
    handler: Callable[[ModelRequest], ModelResponse]
) -> ModelResponse:
    """Filter tools based on conversation State."""
    # Read from State: check if user has authenticated
    state = request.state
    is_authenticated = state.get("authenticated", False)
    message_count = len(state["messages"])

    # Only enable sensitive tools after authentication
    if not is_authenticated:
        tools = [t for t in request.tools if t.name.startswith("public_")]
        request = request.override(tools=tools)
    elif message_count < 5:
        # Limit tools early in conversation
        tools = [t for t in request.tools if t.name != "advanced_search"]
        request = request.override(tools=tools)

    return handler(request)

agent = create_agent(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    tools=[public_search, private_search, advanced_search],
    middleware=[state_based_tools]
)
```

*
  * When tools are discovered or created at runtime (e.g., loaded from an MCP server, generated based on user data, or fetched from a remote registry), you need to both register the tools and handle their execution dynamically.
  1. `wrap_model_call` - Add the dynamic tools to the request
  2. `wrap_tool_call` - Handle execution of the dynamically added tools

```python
from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, ModelRequest, ToolCallRequest

# A tool that will be added dynamically at runtime
@tool
def calculate_tip(bill_amount: float, tip_percentage: float = 20.0) -> str:
    """Calculate the tip amount for a bill."""
    tip = bill_amount * (tip_percentage / 100)
    return f"Tip: ${tip:.2f}, Total: ${bill_amount + tip:.2f}"

class DynamicToolMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    """Middleware that registers and handles dynamic tools."""

    def wrap_model_call(self, request: ModelRequest, handler):
        # Add dynamic tool to the request
        # This could be loaded from an MCP server, database, etc.
        updated = request.override(tools=[*request.tools, calculate_tip])
        return handler(updated)

    def wrap_tool_call(self, request: ToolCallRequest, handler):
        # Handle execution of the dynamic tool
        if request.tool_call["name"] == "calculate_tip":
            return handler(request.override(tool=calculate_tip))
        return handler(request)

agent = create_agent(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    tools=[get_weather],  # Only static tools registered here
    middleware=[DynamicToolMiddleware()],
)

# The agent can now use both get_weather AND calculate_tip
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Calculate a 20% tip on $85"}]
})
```
